[Generation kWh] is a campaign to design a feasible alternative
to electricity self-production in the Spanish market.
Spanish market legislation has been designed in a way quite
hostile towards distributed renewable energies and user self-production
and we propose _collective self-production_ as a formula that still
fits in the market.

The goal of the campaign is to collect investment from cooperative members
for new renewable production projects.
Investors don't get an interest rate in exchange for their investment
but the right to use kWh produced in such plants at cost price,
instead the price derived from the official auction.
Being a marginalist auction, the inclusion of expensive fossil sources
into the national mix, raises the final price to be paid for every source.

This package holds the business logic to handle the use rights
coming from the production plants related to this campaing and
transfer them to user invoices.
