# somenergia-generationkwh

OpenERP module and library to manage [Som Energia]'s Generation kWh

[Generation kWh] is a campaign to make feasible electricity autoproduction
in the Spanish market, which has been quite hostile to the development
of reneable and auto-production (at least as it is in 2015).

[Som Energia]:https://somenergia.coop

The goal of the campaign is to collect investment for new renovable
production plants from the cooperative members not in exchange of
an interest but in exchage of the right to use the kWh produced
at the cost of production, instead of the prices derived from the
official action which fixes the market price and tend to be
higher due to the introduction into the mix of expensive fossile
sources.

This package holds the business logic to handle the rights coming
from the production plants related to this campaing and transfer
them to user invoices.
