OpenERP module and library to manage [Som Energia]'s Generation kWh

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Som-Energia/somenergia-generationkwh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Som-Energia/somenergia-generationkwh)

[Generation kWh] is a campaign to make feasible electricity autoproduction
in the Spanish market.
Such market has been quite hostile to the development of renewable and
user auto-production (at least as it was in years prior to 2015).

[Generation kWh]:https://generationkwh.org
[Som Energia]:https://somenergia.coop

The goal of the campaign is to collect from the cooperative members
investment for new renewable production projects.
Investors don't get an interest rate in exchange for their investment
but the right to use kWh produced in such plants at cost price,
instead the price derived from the official auction.

This package holds the business logic to handle the use rights
coming from the production plants related to this campaing and
transfer them to user invoices.
