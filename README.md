# somenergia-generationkwh

OpenERP module and library to manage [Som Energia]'s Generation kWh

[Generation kWh] is a campaign to make feasible electricity autoproduction
in the Spanish market.
Such market has been quite hostile to the development of renewable and
user auto-production (at least as it was in years prior to 2015).

[Som Energia]:https://somenergia.coop

The goal of the campaign is to collect investment for new renewable
production plants from the cooperative members not in exchange of
an interest but in exchage of the right to use the kWh produced
at real production costs, instead of the prices derived from the
official auction which tend to be higher due to the introduction
into the mix of expensive fossil sources.

This package holds the business logic to handle the use rights
coming from the production plants related to this campaing and
transfer them to user invoices.
