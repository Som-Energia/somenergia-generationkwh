# somenergia-generationkwh

OpenERP module and library to manage Som Energia's Generation kWh

_Generation kWh_ is a campaign to make feasible electricity autoproduction
in the renovable hostile Spanish market (at least as it is in 2015).

The goal of the campaign is to collect investment for new renovable
production plants from the cooperative members not in exchange of
an interest but in exchage of the right to use the kWh produced
at the cost of production, instead of the prices derived from the
marginalistic auction which tend to be higher.

This module holds the business logic to handle the rights coming
from the production plants related to this campaing and transfer
them to invoicing.
