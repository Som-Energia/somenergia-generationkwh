Domain Criteria
===============

This file holds a log of statements that capture conclusions on discussions with the stakeholders about the domain and the functionality.

People involved in the discussion are [marked within brackets].

**Embrace the change:**
These are not immutable laws at all.
If you think some criteria are no longer true,
this is a log providing way to track who you need to talk to.

Invoices
--------

- Generation kWh Line Product Name format 'Pn Gkwh' [Marc-Agusti]
- A contract with Generation kWh activated, must show 'Pn GkWh' invoice lines even if assigned production is 0 kWh [Marc-Agusti]

Production and shares
---------------------

- Production must be divided by the total shares of each activated plant. [Nuria-David]
	- Not dividing by the total of active owned shares. [Nuria-David]
	- Collorary 1: when not all shares are bought, remaining production goes to the cooperative. [Nuria-David]
- Plants are activated for generation at an arbitrary date. [Nuria-David]
- There is no deactivation date for plants (by now, to be reconsidered later). [Nuria-David]
- Activation date for owned shares is fixed by adding a given number of days (delay, _carencia_) to the purchase date [Nuria-David]
- Delay can be different for share batches. Batches can be set either
	- by selecting by purchase date (between two dates) or
	- by purchasing order (till the nth action). [Nuria-David]
- The purchase date is the date the member orders, not the payment day [Gijsbert-Marc-Eduard]

Doubts
------

- [David] Do shares expire a number of years after the purchase date or after the activation date?
- [David] Can a plant be activated before metering is available? Consequences?
- [David] Can a plant be activated after metering is available? Consequences?
- [David] Defining the time span of the plant shares. When they get extinct?
- [David] When is a contract considered to be activated for GenkWh? If active during the invoicing period?
